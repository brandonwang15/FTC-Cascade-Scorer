FTC-Cascade-Scorer
==================
Currently done-ish:
-Drawing autonomous routes
-Saving drawn autonomous routes

Currently being planned:
-Match scoring (auto, teleop, end game)
-Saving matches
-View match overview and data visualization
-Reorgnizing fragment and activity structure sothat all this can fit on one app (navigation drawer?)



Random ideas:
-export to spreadsheet file
-nfc sharing of data / nfc sync between scouts to build a master file
